This folder contains four R script files:

1. single_bootstrap_t.R
This script implements the single parametric bootstrap method for generating empirical best linear prediction intervals, assuming the random effects follow a t-distribution.

2. single_double_bootstrap_SE.R
This script includes both the single and double parametric bootstrap methods for generating empirical best linear prediction intervals, assuming the random effects follow a shifted exponential distribution.

3. SAIPE data analysis
This script includes the code for section 6 real data analysis.

4. basic function.R
This script includes to common for some basic functions, including Prasad-Rao variance estimation, Fay-Herriot variance estimation and EBLUP calculation.
