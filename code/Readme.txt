This folder contains 3 R scripts and 4 RData files used for implementing and evaluating bootstrap methods under different simulation settings.

"basic functions.R" provides basic functions for Prasad-Rao variance estimation, Fay-Herriot variance estimation, and EBLUP calculation

"single bootstrap t.R" provides the codes for implementing single bootstrap method when the level 2 follows a t distribution.

"table2_m50_t9.RData" includes the results for implementing single bootstrap method when the level 2 follows a t9 distribution with 50 small areas (m = 50), corresponding to table 2 in the manuscript.

"table3_m15_t9.RData" includes the results for implementing single bootstrap method when the level 2 follows a t9 distribution with 15 small areas equals to 15 (m = 15), corresponding to table 3 in the manuscript.

"single_double_Bootstrap_SE.R" provides the codes for implementing both single and double bootstrap methods when the level 2 follows a shifted exponential distribution.

"table5_m50_se.RData" includes the results for implementing both single and double bootstrap methods when the level 2 follows a shifted exponential distribution with 50 small areas (m = 50), corresponding to table 5 in the manuscript.

"table6_m15_se.RData" includes the results for implementing both single and double bootstrap method when the level 2 follows a shifted exponential distribution wit 15 small areas, corresponding to table 6 in the manuscript.
