This GitHub repository contains reproducibility materials for our paper, "Impact of Existence and Nonexistence of Pivot on the Coverage of Empirical Best Linear Prediction Intervals for Small Areas."

The code folder includes scripts for the simulation studies and real data analysis. A README file is provided in the same folder with instructions on how to reproduce the tables and figures in our paper.

All table values can be reproduced using the output provided in the output folder, eliminating the need to rerun the code.
